### Project Overview

This Library Management System (LMS) project aims to efficiently manage extensive book information, memberships, clientele, profiles, and accounts. Its database consolidates a vast amount of data, presenting it through an intuitive and easily navigable interface for user convenience. 


#### Scope

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive resource management system for books and magazines. It will store key details such as title, author, ISBN/issue number, publication date, genre, and availability.
Additionally, the system will feature a client and membership management component. This will include unique IDs, contact information, various membership categories (regular, student, senior), and defined borrowing restrictions.
A tracking system will be implemented to manage borrowed, returned, and reserved media. This system will record timestamps, client details, and enforce rules regarding borrowing limits and late return fees.
Finally, a user interface will be developed to enable staff to efficiently manage operations. This includes checking out and returning items, adding new resources, managing client accounts, calculating fines, and viewing both resource availability and client profiles.
